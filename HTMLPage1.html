            "Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Danny Ings and Conor Coady scored their first England goals in a 3-0 victory over Wales in a friendly on Thursday when international football returned to Wembley after 11 months.
It was the least experienced lineup deployed by England in four decades, with only 54 international appearances among the starting XI and Calvert-Lewin one of two players making their debuts.
Reproducing the form with Everton that earned him a first call-up, the striker took only 26 minutes to head in from Jack Grealish’s cross inside an empty north London stadium.
“It is a shame there are no fans here to celebrate, and my family could have been here, so bittersweet in that sense,” the 23-year-old Calvert-Lewin said. “I have worked very hard to get here, it has felt like a long road."
